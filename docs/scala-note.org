* Four Essential effects in programming

  |              | One       | Many          |
  |--------------+-----------+---------------|
  | Synchronous  | T/Try[T]  | Iterable[T]   |
  | Asynchronous | Future[T] | Observable[T] |

  - Future[T] is roughly Try[T] => Unit
    which is the dual of Try[T]

  - Iterable[T] is roughly next: Unit => Try[Option[T]]
    its dual is Observable
